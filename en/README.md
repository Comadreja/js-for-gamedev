# JavaScript for video game development

This is an introductory guide to **JavaScript**, oriented to the development of **HTML5 video games**.

It is based upon materials we have developed in cooperation with the Universidad Complutense de Madrid for the _Video game development with interpreted languages_ course. You can access the original course materials through [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/clnznr/pvli2017).

The source code to this guide is also [published on GitHub](https://github.com/mozdevs/js-for-gamedev/). If you find any errors or want to suggest any changes, please let us know by [submitting a ticket](https://github.com/mozdevs/js-for-gamedev/issues).

## Video games on the Web

The arrival of **HTML5** and its associated technologies has massively expanded the Web's capabilities as a **video gaming platform**. Until then, most Web-based video games required an external plugin –such as Flash or Unity Player–, but nowadays those are no longer needed, and HTML5 video games are seamlessly run in the browser.

The Web offers **APIs** for 2D & 3D graphics (the latter based on the OpenGL ES standard), audio playback and synthesis, multiple input methods (_gamepads_, _touch_ events, gyroscopes…), etc. In a nutshell, everything we need in order to develop video games.

There is a plethora of available **engines and tools** for the creation of HTML5 video games. Some of the most popular engines, such as Unity, Unreal or Game Maker, already feature HTML5 exporters. There also are Web-specific engines and frameworks on which we can develop in JavaScript, such as Phaser or PlayCanvas.

This guide's objective is to provide a JavaScript knowledge base, so that you can develop Web video games by using existing libraries or Web engines.

## For whom is this guide meant?

- For anyone interested in video game development and in possession of some **minimal programming knowledge** (any language will do, such as Lua, C or Python): variables, loops, functions, conditionals, etc.

- For video game programmers who want to develop Web video games with JavaScript.

- For Web developers who want to learn the fundamentals of object-oriented programming with JavaScript.
