# The JavaScript execution model

One of JavaScript's signature features is its **asynchronous execution model**, where results are not immediately available, but will be in the future.

## Scope and _hoisting_

As in so many other languages, the names of variables can be reutilized to store different values, as long as they are located in **different scopes**.

A variable's _scope_ is the segment of code where it can be used. Variables with the same name in different scopes are different variables.

In JavaScript, scope is the **function's body**, demarcated by the pair of braces `{` and `}` which follow the function's parameter list.

```js
function introduction() {
    // This is the variable, text.
    var text = 'I\'m Ziltoid, the Omniscient.';
    greetings();
    console.log(text);
}

function greetings(list) {
    // And this is a different variable, also called text.
    var text = 'Greetings humans!';
    console.log(text);
}

introduction();
```

In JavaScript, functions can be defined within other functions, thereby enabling nested scopes.

Function nesting is useful when we want to use **auxiliar functions**, which are normally short.

```js
function getEven(list) {
    function isEven(n) {
        return n % 2 === 0;
    }
    return list.filter(isEven);
}

getEven([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]);
```

Since the scope is that of the function itself, the same name in a nested function can refer to two things:

1) **If it is used with `var`**, we are referring to **another different variable**:

```js
function introduction() {
    // This is a variable, text.
    var text = 'I\'m Ziltoid, the Omniscient.';

    function greetings(list) {
        // And this is ANOTHER different variable called text.
        var text = 'Greetings humans!';
        console.log(text);
    }

    greetings();
    console.log(text);
}

introduction();
```

In the above case, we say that the variable `text` from the nested function `greetings` _conceals_ the variable `text` from the function `introduction`.

Remember that, in order to introduce a new variable, we have to declare it with `var` before using it (or at the same time we are assigning it).

2) If we skip the word `var`, no new variable is created, but it is the existing one that is **reused**.

```js
function introduction() {
  // This is a variable called text.
  var text = 'I\'m Ziltoid, the Omniscient.';

  function greetings(list) {
    // This is THE SAME variable called text as the one outside.
    text = 'Greetings humans!';
    console.log(text);
  }

  greetings();
  console.log(text);
}

introduction();
```

### _Hoisting_

_Hoisting_, in the context of programming, refers to a mechanism some languages employ in regards to name declaration.

In JavaScript, it makes no difference at which point through a function we declare a variable. JavaScript parses any declaration as occurring at the beginning of the function.

I.e., this:

```js
function f() {
    for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        for (var j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
            console.log('i: ', i, ' j: ', j);
        }
    }
}
```

Is equivalent to this:

```js
function f() {
    var i;
    var j;
    for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        for (j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
            console.log('i: ', i, ' j: ', j);
        }
    }
}
```

Do notice that JavaScript **_hoists_ the declaration** of the variable (it takes it to the beginning), not its initialization. That is the reason the following piece of code does not fail, but prints out `undefined`:

```js
function f() {
    console.log(i);
    var i = 5;
}
f();
```

In **strict mode**, using a variable that has not been declared will cause an error.

```js
function f() {
    console.log(i);
    i = 5;
}
f();
```

This is not an issue with **function declarations**: when a function declaration is hoisted, it is hoisted as a whole, _definition included_.

```js
function getEven(list) {
    return list.filter(isEven);

    function isEven(n) {
        return n % 2 === 0;
    }
}

getEven([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]);
```

This allows a way of arranging code that might be clearer, placing auxiliar functions right after the functions that use them.

This way, just from a look at the first line of the function, we can know what it does.

```js
    return list.filter(isEven);
```

And, should we still be in doubt, we can continue to read and look into what the auxiliar function does.

```js
    function isEven(n) {
        return n % 2 === 0;
    }
```

Do notice that for this way of writing code to be clear, the names we use for auxiliar functions must be suitable, descriptive, and give us hints about the value they return.

## _Closures_

Functions are data and are created every time a `function` instruction is found. This way, we can create functions that return functions.

```js
function buildFunction() {
    return function () { return 42; };
}

var f = buildFunction();
var g = buildFunction();

typeof f === 'function';
typeof g === 'function';

f();
g(); // Both functions do the same thing...

f !== g; // ...but are NOT the same function
```

On its own, this is not a very powerful mechanism; but knowing that a nested function can access the variables from higher scopes, we can do something like this:

```js
function newDie(sides) {
  return function () {
    return Math.floor(Math.random() * sides) + 1;
  };
}
var d100 = newDie(100);
var d20 = newDie(20);

d100 !== d20; // different, created in two different newDie calls.

d100();
d20();
```

In JavaScript, functions **retain the access to variables from higher scopes**. A function referring to any variable from a higher scope is called a **_closure_**.

**This does not affect the value of `this`**, which will continue to be the message's addressee.

### Methods, _closures_ and `this`

Consider the following example:

```js
var diceUtils = {
    history: [], // keeps the roll history.

    newDie: function (sides) {
        return function die() {
            var result = Math.floor(Math.random() * sides) + 1;
            this.history.push([new Date(), sides, result]);
            return result;
        }
    }
}
```

Our intent is to be able to create dice and keep a record of all the rolls we make with these dice.

However, this does not work:

```js
var d10 = diceUtils.newDie(10);
d10(); // error!
```

This is so because **`this` is always the message's addressee** and `d10` is being called as if it were a function rather than a method.

Remember that we can make any function take a fixed value as `this` with `.apply()`; so this does work, although it is not very convenient:

```js
d10.apply(diceUtils);
d10.apply(diceUtils);
diceUtils.history;
```

What we need to do is to make it so that the function `die` within `newDie` will refer to the `this` from the higher scope, not its own.

We can achieve this in two different ways. The first is a mere play on variables, storing `this`to an auxiliar variable (in this case, `self`):

```js
var diceUtils = {
    history: [], // keeps the dice record.

    newDie: function (sides) {
        var self = this; // self is now the addressee of newDie.

        return function die() {
            var result = Math.floor(Math.random() * sides) + 1;
            // by using self, we refer to newDie's addressee.
            self.history.push([new Date(), sides, result]);
            return result;
        }
    }
}
```

This does work, and is far more convenient:

```js
var d10 = diceUtils.newDie(10);
var d6 = diceUtils.newDie(6);
d10();
d6();
d10();
diceUtils.history;
```

The seconf way is to use the functions' **[`bind`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Function/bind) method**.

A function's `bind` method returns another function whose `this` will be the first parameter of `bind`. Thus:

```js
var diceUtils = {
    history: [], // keeps the dice record.

    newDie: function (sides) {
        return die.bind(this); // a new function that will call die with its addressee set on the first parameter.

        function die() {
            var result = Math.floor(Math.random() * sides) + 1;
            this.history.push([new Date(), sides, result]);
            return result;
        }
    }
}
```

Both forms are widely used, but the first is often seen written this way:

```js
var diceUtils = {
    history: [], // keeps the dice record.

    newDie: function (sides) {
        return function die() {
            var result = Math.floor(Math.random() * sides) + 1;
            this.history.push([new Date(), sides, result]);
            return result;
        }.bind(this); // bind follows the function expression.
    }
}
```

## Modules

This section introduces the **modules** feature, which is specific to Node.

One of the main disadvantages to JavaScript ([until next version](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import)) is that there is no way of arranging code in modules.

Modules are useful for isolating related functionality: types, functions, constants, configurationâ€¦

Node _does have modules_ and, fortunately, there are **tools that simulate modules** like Node's on the browser.

In Node, JavaScript files ending by `.js`are modules. Node allows us to expose or **export functionality** from a module, placing it within the object `module.exports`:

```js
// In diceUtils.js
"use strict"; // sets the module to strict mode.

var history = [];

function newDie(sides) {
    return function die() {
        var result = Math.floor(Math.random() * sides) + 1;
        history.push([new Date(), sides, result]);
        return result;
    };
}

// What is exported is actually the object module.exports!
module.exports.newDie = newDie;
module.exports.history = history;
```

What is actually exported is **always `module.exports`**, which starts out as an empty object:

```js
typeof module.exports;
module.exports;
```

Now we can **import that module** within another:

```js
// In cthulhuRpg.js
"use strict";

var diceUtils = require('./diceUtils');
var d100 = diceUtils.newDie(100);

var howard = {
    sanity: 45,
    sanityCheck: function () {
        if (d100() <= this.sanity) {
            console.log('Horrifying, but I\'ll manage. That was close.');
        } else {
            console.log(
                'Â¡Ph\'nglui mglw\'nafh Cthulhu R\'lyeh wgah\'nagl fhtagn!');
        }
    }
};
howard.sanityCheck();
```

In order to import one module from another we need to pass to [`require`](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_module_require_id) the **relative route** to the module file we want to import.

If we pass a name instead of a route, we will access the **default funcionality** that comes with Node (modules that are part of the standard library, such as `path` or `fs`) or the one we install from third parties (for instance, modules installed with the npm package manager). We shall use this form in a couple of occasions later on.

## Differences in scope between Node and the browser

It has been said that scope in JavaScript is equivalent to the function, but we also know that we can open a console or a file and start declaring variables without any need for writing functions.

This happens because we are using the **global scope**. The global scope is available both to the browser and Node.

```js
// This is a variable called text within the GLOBAL scope.
var text = 'I\'m Ziltoid, the Omniscient.';

// This is a function within the GLOBAL scope.
function greetings(list) {
    // This is ANOTHER variable called text, within the function's scope.
    var text = 'Greetings humans!';
    console.log(text);
}

greetings();
console.log(text);
```

However, there is a peculiarity to Node. The global scope is actually _local in regards to the file_. This means that:

```js
// In a.js, text is only visible from within the FILE.
"use strict";
var text = 'I\'m Ziltoid, the Omniscient.';

// In b.js, text is only visible from within the FILE.
"use strict";
var text = 'Greetings humans!';

// In a console run from the same directory as a & b
require('./a');
require('./b');
text;
```

## Events and asynchronous programming

Try the following example (copy, paste and wait for 5 seconds):

```js
var fiveSeconds = 5 * 1000; // in milliseconds.

// This happens now.
console.log('T: ', new Date());

setTimeout(function () {
    // This happens after 5 seconds.
    console.log('T + 5 segundos: ', new Date());
}, fiveSeconds);

// This happens immediately thereafter
console.log('T + delta: ', new Date());
```

As you can realize, the message is completed after 5 seconds because what [`setTimeout`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/setTimeout) does is call the function as soon as the stated amount of milliseconds has elapsed.

We say a function is a **_callback_** if it is called at some point in the future â€“that is to say, **asynchronously**â€“ in order to report on some result.

In the `setTimeout` example, the result is that the specified amount of time has passed.

### Events

In this section we will look at the **`readline` module**, which is specific to Node.

Asynchronous programming is used in JavaScript and other languages to **model events**, mainly input/output waits. In other words: milestones that happen without us knowing when.

Input/output â€“from now on, I/Oâ€“ does not just consist of reading from files or network requests, but also waiting for an action on the user's part.

As an example, we shall implement a line-by-line dialog console. We will use the [`readline`](https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html) module, which is a part of the standard library that comes built in with node:

```js
// In conversational.js
"use strict";

var readline = require('readline');

var cmd = readline.createInterface({
    input: process.stdin,  // this way, we reference the console as input.
    output: process.stdout, // and this way, as output.
    prompt: '(â•¯Â°â–¡Â°ï¼‰â•¯ ' // what shows up in order to wait for user input.
});
```

Launch that program with Node and you will see it does nothing, **yet neither does it end**. This is typical of asynchronous programs: the program remains in wait for something to happen. Press `ctrl+c` to terminate the program.

Now try this:

```js
// Add at the end of conversational.js
console.log('Write something and press enter');
cmd.prompt(); // asks the user to write something.

cmd.on('line', function (input) {
    console.log('You have said "' + input  + '"');
    cmd.prompt(); // asks the user to write something.
});
```

What you have achieved is to **listen for the `line` event** that happens [every time a new line character is input](https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html#readline_event_line).

Speaking of events, the function that is asynchronously executed is called **listener**, but it is not uncommon for it to be called _callback_.

Expressions like "**registering a _listener_** for an event", "subscribing to an event" or "listening for an event" mean utilizing the mechanism that allows the association of a function's execution to said event.

All of this said, we cannot exit the prior program yet. We need to make some further changes:

```js
// Add to conversational.js
cmd.on('line', function (input) {
    if (input === 'exit') {
        cmd.close();
    }
});

cmd.on('close', function () {
    console.log('See you!');
    process.exit(0); // exits node.
});
```

We have added a second _listener_ to the `line` event and **both will be run**. The first manages the default behavior (which is to repeat what the user has typed in), and the second deals specifically with the `exit` command.

If the line is exactly `exit`, we will close the command line interface. This causes a `close` event and, when we receive it, we will use that event's _listener_ in order to terminate the program.

The `on` method is a second name for [`addListener`](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_emitter_addlistener_eventname_listener).

Same way we can add a _listner_, we can also remove it with [`removeListener`](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_emitter_removelistener_eventname_listener),
or remove all of them with [`removeAllListeners`](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_emitter_removealllisteners_eventname).

We can listen for an event **just once** with [`once`](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_emitter_once_eventname_listener).

### Event broadcasters

Now we will cover the `EventEmitter` class, which is also specific to Node.

Events are not a standard mechanism to JavaScript. They are a convenient way of modeling certain types of problems; but a JavaScript object, on its own, **has no event broadcasting API**.

In Node, we can rely on several alternatives in order to have objects broadcast events:



- Implementar nuestra propia API de eventos.

- Hacer que nuestros objetos **usen** una instancia de `EventEmitter`.

- Hacer que nuestros objetos **sean instancias** de `EventEmitter`.

La primera supondrÃ­a crear nuestro propio mÃ©todo `on` y los mecanismos para
emitir eventos. La segunda y la tercera usan la clase
[`EventEmitter`](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_eventemitter),
que ya implementa esta API.

Este es un ejemplo de la opciÃ³n 3 â€“el cual aprovechamos para repasar la
herencia:

```js
var events = require('events');
var EventEmitter = events.EventEmitter;

function Ship() {
    EventEmitter.apply(this);
    this._ammunition = 'laser charges';
}

Ship.prototype = Object.create(EventEmitter.prototype);
Ship.prototype.constructor = Nave;

var ship = new Ship();
ship.on; // Â¡existe!
```

Ahora que la nave puede emitir eventos, vamos a hacer que dispare y que emita un
evento.

```js
Ship.prototype.shoot = function () {
    console.log('PICHIUM!');
    this.emit('shoot', this._ammunition); // parte de la API de EventEmitter.
};

ship.on('shoot', function (ammunition) {
    console.log('CENTRO DE MANDO. La nave ha disparado:', ammunition);
});

ship.shoot();
```

**Emitir un evento** consiste en llamar al mÃ©todo
[`emit`](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_emitter_emit_eventname_arg1_arg2),
que harÃ¡ que se ejecuten los _listeners_ que escuchan tal evento.

Los eventos son increiblemente Ãºtiles para modelar interfaces de usuario de
forma genÃ©rica.

Para ello, los modelos deben **publicar** quÃ© les ocurre: cÃ³mo cambian, quÃ©
hacenâ€¦ Todo **a base de eventos**. Las interfaces de usuario se
**suscribirÃ¡n** a estos eventos y proporcionarÃ¡n la informaciÃ³n visual adecuada.

Este modelo permite ademÃ¡s que varias interfaces de usuario funcionen al mismo
tiempo, todas escuchando los mismos eventos. Sin embargo, tambiÃ©n permite
dividir la interfaz en otras mÃ¡s especializadas, cada una escuchando un
determinado conjunto de eventos.
